* [Pull Request](https://github.com/rri-dev/rri-core-api-v3/pull/1)

# Summary

* creates an npm package that wraps `@slack/web-api` with some convenient methods
* `sendMessage` - accepts a string, and optional channel id
* `sendCsv` - accepts a header string array, and rows object to send a csv file to the slack channel
* `sendCsvFromObjectArray` - accepts an object array, and sends a csv file to the slack channel
    - sending flattened objects is recommended as they parse better into a _CSV_
